# tess-tica
This repository contains codes that demonstrates the use of [TICA](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tica) (TESS Image CAlibrator Full Frame Images) calibrated images to extract lightcurves.

Whenever PLD used, the codes are highly inspired from the tutorials by NÃ©stor Espinoza on the subject: [PLD-TESS](https://github.com/nespinoza/PLD-TESS). A huge thanks to him!
